<h1><center>EFFECTS</center></h1>
<h2><center>Microwaves are best known for their dielectric heating abilities. While this isn't unique to microwaves, their human-scale size makes them the best choice. Dielectric heating occurs when the fluctuating charge from an electromagnetic field forces a polar molecule like water to flip back and forth to match charges, rapidly moving the molecules and causing the material to heat up. Microwave radiation is non-ionizing, and therefore not nearly as dangerous as x-rays or gamma rays, but could still theroretically cause burns if a person was hit with enough mircrowaves.

<h1><center>HISTORY</center></h1>
<h2><center>Microwaves were discovered along with the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum by James Clerk Maxwell, Oliver Heaviside, and Heinrich Hertz in the late 1800s. Microwaves were not used in any applications until World War II when they were utilized in radar systems. After continued radar development the microwave's potential was also found in dielectric heating and telecommunications.</center></h2>
