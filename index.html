<center>MICROWAVES</center>

<h1><center>CHARACTERISTICS</center></h1>
<h2><center>Frequency range: 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> Hertz | Wavelength: 0.3 meters to 0.3 millimeters</center></h2>

<h1><center>EFFECTS</center></h1>
<h2><center>Microwaves are best known for their dielectric heating abilities. While this isn't unique to microwaves, their human-scale size makes them the best choice. Dielectric heating occurs when the fluctuating charge from an electromagnetic field forces a polar molecule like water to flip back and forth to match charges, rapidly moving the molecules and causing the material to heat up. Microwave radiation is non-ionizing, and therefore not nearly as dangerous as x-rays or gamma rays, but could still theroretically cause burns if a person was hit with enough mircrowaves.

<h1><center>HISTORY</center></h1>
<h2><center>Microwaves were discovered along with the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum by James Clerk Maxwell, Oliver Heaviside, and Heinrich Hertz in the late 1800s. Microwaves were not used in any applications until World War II when they were utilized in radar systems. After continued radar development the microwave's potential was also found in dielectric heating and telecommunications.</center></h2>

<h1><center>SOURCES & DETECTION</center></h1>
<h2><center>Microwaves are naturally produced as one of the many wavelengths of EM radiation that stars constantly emit. Microwaves permeate the entire galaxy. Many man-made devices also produce microwaves like magnetrons, which oscillate charged anodes and cathodes to produce a directional electron beam on the microwave frequency. Some radio broadcasts and other wireless transmissions transmit over longer microwave wavelengths. Also like radio waves, microwaves are collected using antennas and dishes which can process them into usefuk electric signals.</center></h2>

<h1><center>APPLICATIONS</center></h1>
<h2><center>Microwaves have many applications today both big and small. We use microwaves in our home to heat food in just minutes. Microwaves are used in radars for both conventional military purposes and on satellites to track weather phenomena to centimeter precision. Microwaves are widely used in telecommunications such as in cell phone signals and short-wave telvision. Their small size means antennas don't need to be as large and noise is reduced. Microwave recievers can be large however, as is the case with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe which took the famous cosmic microwave background photo.</center></h2>
